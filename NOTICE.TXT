Bitbucket for Grails Spring Security OAuth plugin
Copyright 2015 Mattias Nordvall

This plugin extends the "Spring Security OAuth plugin" and is based on the various provider plugins developed by
Mihai Cazacu, Enrico Comiti and Alexey Zhokhov. Thank you for your work!

It also uses the "scribe-java-bitbucket" api definition, developed by me, and available at
